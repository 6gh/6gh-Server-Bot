# 6gh's Server Bot

A Discord bot to manage [my server](https://discord.gg/atE7gzs).

## WIP

This project is still a work in progress, plus my server is dead and therefore this is just useless (besides having fun or something)

> Note: I am dumb-dumb when code. Also, [The Wiki](https://github.com/6gh/6gh-Server-Bot/wiki/) is not set up at this moment. Please bare with me, it'll be a while for it to go up

## Info

I made this bot for the sole purpose of using it to manage [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/atE7gzs) and no other reason whatsoever. I wanted full control on how to manage it and how I would like auto-moderation to work, so I made this bot.

## How to use

You can use this bot in two ways:

### Use it in my server

You can use by [joining my server](https://discord.gg/atE7gzs), and using the help command to get started. Chances are the prefix is "\[" but if I changed it you can check the #info channel in the bot category. [List of Commands](https://github.com/6gh/6gh-Server-Bot/wiki/Commands)

### Use it with your own token/bot

You can clone/download this repository, and then make a .env file with the content `TOKEN=your-token-here`. Change the server ID in the config.json to your server ID, and start! ([Almost complete setup guide](https://github.com/6gh/6gh-Server-Bot/wiki/Setup-And-Installation))

## Reporting bugs/issues

If you encounter any issue with this bot you can use the [issues tab](https://github.com/6gh/6gh-Server-Bot/issues) and check if your issue is already solved there, or create a new issue.

Alternatively, you can DM me on Discord (6gh#7369) and tell me your issue there. Send a friend request if you can't DM me, and I'll accept shortly.

> Note: If you DM me an advertisement you will be blocked and/or removed as a friend (if added).
